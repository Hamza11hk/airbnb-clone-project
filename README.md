### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is essential in a booking system because:  
1. **Improves User Retention**: Simplifying the booking process ensures users stay on the platform longer and return for future bookings.  
2. **Builds Trust**: A polished and accessible interface fosters confidence in the platform’s reliability.  
3. **Reduces Errors**: Intuitive navigation minimizes user errors during critical actions like selecting dates or completing payments.  
4. **Enhances Accessibility**: By following design standards, the system becomes usable for a broader audience, including those with disabilities.  
5. **Encourages Engagement**: Engaging visuals and interactive elements improve user satisfaction and drive conversions.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Understanding the design properties of a mockup is critical because:  
1. **Ensures Consistency**: Using predefined styles for colors and typography maintains a unified look across the application.  
2. **Streamlines Development**: Identifying design details early reduces back-and-forth between design and development teams.  
3. **Improves Accessibility**: Proper font sizes, weights, and color contrasts enhance readability and usability for all users.  
4. **Facilitates Scalability**: Consistent design elements make it easier to expand the project without introducing visual inconsistencies.  
5. **Speeds Up Prototyping**: Leveraging Figma’s design properties helps in quickly iterating and finalizing the UI design.
